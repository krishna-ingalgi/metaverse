      <h2>More on Simulation</h2>

      <p>
        The metaverse could be a fit for manufacturing, in particular, where
        considerations like labor costs, inventory, and the speed of production
        dictate decision-making. As IoT For All's Roshan Srinivasan writes,
        manufacturers generally aim to optimize production based on demand
        forecasts using signals like seasonality and market size.<br />
        With the addition of simulation, the metaverse adds an additional
        universe, the universe of timeline.<br />

        Simulation, and complex systems simulation in particular, enables
        organizations to test the impact of their potential choices on their
        systems and ecosystem, and to understand what lies ahead on any future
        timeline.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuous simulation and automation:- A continuous simulation capacity
        offers organizations four distinct advantages: the opportunity to answer
        every 'what- if' question in real time, the chance to generate optimal
        'how-to' plans, a means to continuously and automatically optimize a
        system, and the possibility to maintain continuous and holistic
        visibility of their entire system and its future. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Future-proofing in an era of uncertainty:- The automotive sector stands
        as an example of an industry where established companies are facing
        difficult transitions. The same companies that transformed production
        lines in the early 20th century and reimagined manufacturing processes
        in the 1970s and 1980s, now find themselves challenged on multiple
        fronts. 'Just-in-time' supply chains have been disrupted by a global
        pandemic. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The promise of the metaverse fulfilled:- The metaverse will give these
        long-established firms the ability to accelerate their transformation
        while leveraging the assets they've built over decades. They will have
        an opportunity to understand their own complex organization at different
        levels of granularity at different scopes of space and time. They will
        have a chance to experiment with their simulation digital twins and
        continuously project themselves into the future. <br />
