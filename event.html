      <h2>What are Events in Metaverse?</h2>
      <p>
        Metaverse events are virtual gatherings of people hosted over a
        metaverse platform, like Queppelin's Metaverse. An event of any format
        can be organized in the metaverse, limited only by imagination, whether
        it's a business gathering or a rock concert.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Queppelin's Metaverse Platform offers high compatibility so that users
        can access such metaverse events from any device, whether a desktop or a
        smartphone. The participants of the metaverse events can wear their
        headsets or sit down in front of their screens.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The first way the metaverse is changing the event industry is through
        improved quality and immersion of event experiences. In an event held in
        the metaverse, attendees are able to access a fully immersive event
        experience, where they have the freedom to engage with features and
        activities at their leisure. This is especially applicable to large
        events with multiple speakers or attractions that are available
        simultaneously, such as a trade fair or large conference. Attendees can
        virtually walk around at their own pace, giving attention to elements
        that interest them.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of events, the metaverse means attendees entering a
        digital event space as their personalised avatar and having the freedom
        to move around, interact with other attendees, and ultimately curate
        their own, unique event experience. This is in contrast to today's
        standard virtual events, where everyone sees the same video feed on
        their screen.<br />
