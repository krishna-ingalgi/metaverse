      <h2>Working in Metaverse?</h2>
      <p>
        An immersive space that can be customised to meet your needs and
        preferences, providing a variety of benefits, including increased
        productivity, flexibility, and creativity.
        <br />

        A collection of virtual reality experiences people can access online is
        becoming more than an elusive buzzword. By 2030, it's anticipated that 5
        billion people will interact on the metaverse, according to a report by
        Citi. For employers, this is an opportunity to rethink how and where we
        work. <br />The use of a metaspace at work could mean employees recreate
        their in-office experience online, as avatars that move around and
        interact with others in a virtual office space. Employers may also adopt
        the use of VR headsets during meetings and conferences to give users a
        completely immersive experience that goes beyond Zoom meetings and Slack
        channels. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the start of the pandemic, engagement has been a leading concern
        for employers 51% of employees are disengaged at work and 13% are
        actively disengaged, meaning they are feeling miserable at work and
        feeling negatively about their environment. <br />The metaverse allows
        employees the freedom to engage with their surroundings, their
        colleagues and their work, all from the comfort of home, Whalen says.

          According to Whalen, And pandemic or not, the metaverse and the
          evolution of how people engage with their workspaces was
          inevitable.</i
