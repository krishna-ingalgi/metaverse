      <h2>How Gaming is possible through Metaverse?</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming is one of the major sectors that use Metaverse to offer a
        next-generation gaming experience to the users. They can engage in a way
        that they had never done before in a competitive gaming world. Moreover,
        they can have an immersive experience that enhances the overall gaming
        experience.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Social Gaming:- Metaverse is inseparably social. It is a feature that
        sets Metaverse apart from the traditional virtual reality experience.
        Multiplayer gaming will certainly have a new dimension with players
        allowed to invite friends from the real world, develop relationships,
        connect with other players, and many more.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Games-as-Platforms-: These games-as platforms offer a superior gaming
        experience to users and come with much more flexibility. Here, users can
        very easily connect to the virtual world, develop sub-games within a
        game, craft their own content, and are able to consider the gaming
        environment as a platform-like space for a number of other
        activities.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Mixed Reality Experience-: Metaverse appropriately combines augmented
        reality and mixed reality to offer a more organic experience. Gaming in
        the Metaverse allows the incorporation of mixed reality, where the
        gamers move from just group text in augmented reality to a mixed reality
        board game to a full-fledged world of virtual reality in a seamless flow
        of work.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Portable Game Assets-: Metaverse's interoperable architecture can permit
        asset portability. Hence, enhancements of avatars and weapons acquired
        in any one game have the possibility of being portable to a different
        environment, and NFT rules would be in control of preserving
        ownership.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Play To Earn-: Play-to-earn happens to be one of the vital elements of
        gaming in the Metaverse. In addition to following linear storytelling
        and rules, the players are also able to engage in various profitable
        activities like selling the assets they have won in the game to other
        users in exchange for crypto.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In Summary-: While metaverse gaming in the way tech enthusiasts envision
        it to be isn't existent right now, big companies are rushing to be the
        first to make this technology a reality.<br />
